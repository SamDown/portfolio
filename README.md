# Sam's Python Development Portfolio

Welcome to my Python development portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects as a Python developer. Each folder here represents a unique project, demonstrating my mastery and passion for problem-solving and innovation in Python.

## Objective
My goal is to become a professional-level Python developer, capable of creating elegant and efficient solutions for a variety of technical challenges. This portfolio reflects my learning journey and ongoing improvement.

## Projects
Each project in this portfolio is thoroughly documented with its own READMEs to explain the concepts, technologies used, and key learnings. Here are some standout projects:
- **Password Generator:** A tool for creating secure and robust passwords.
- *[More projects will be added here as they are developed]*

## Technologies
I use a variety of Python technologies and libraries, including:
- Core Python (variables, loops, conditions)
- Data manipulation libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- And many more!
